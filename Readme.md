Challenge Lab : ML in public health and genomics.

In this assignment, we need to predict "Gestational Age" of women based on the 7 multi-omics high-dimensional datasets as illustrated below. Train data consist of 14 women.

prepare_data.ipynb cleans and prepares data for SC01, SC02, and SC03 and saves them as :

train_sc01.csv
test_sc01.csv

train_sc02.csv
test_sc02.csv

train_sc03.csv
test_sc03.csv

---

sc01.ipynb
sc02.ipynb
sc03.ipynb

produces output for the same and saves them as:

GROUP-5--SC1--RandomForest.csv
GROUP-5--SC2--RandomForest.csv
GROUP-5--SC3--RandomForest.csv
